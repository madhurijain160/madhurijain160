- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Madhuri Jain
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in the field of data science especially medicine, environment and education. 
      In countries like India, people lack basic facilities and I want to explore ways in how AI can help people to lead an improved life. Human beings are at the top of the food       chain hence all of their activities affect the environment and their surroundings in one or the other way. For a human to become responsible for his/her surrounding, it is         crucial that he or she receives correct education. I want to make efforts towards doing that only. A pandemic situation has caused several families to procure cell phones         which is going to be an advantage in making this dream come true.
